      <li>Has a body of a 13 years old.</li>
      <li>Brain of a 6 year old.</li>

    <h4>On the Bright Side</h4>
    <p>I doubt anyone has ever seen someone as mentally retarded as me. But I think the measure of a life <br/>
    is by it's ability to thrive and improve. Pretty sure I suck if we use that standard, but surely <br/>
    gathering valueable experiences could also be called a good use of time.</p>
